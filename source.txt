Notes about PSMS source:
------------------------

PSMS is a port of SMSPlus, the excellent SMS emulator by Charles
Mac Donald. SMSPlus source code is distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License. Since PSMS is a derivative of SMSPlus,
PSMS source code is also distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.

NOTE: PSMS uses other general-purpose free software modules which
      are NOT distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
      License. These modules include:

      - Gfxpipe, by Vzzrzzn
      - ps2lib, by Gustavo Scotti and many others.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, you will need an up-to-date cvs version of ps2lib and
the ee toolchain (ee-gcc & ee-binutils).

WARNING: The PS2 specific code is messy and un-optimised. My goal
was not to produce efficent and easy to read code, just to produce
working code.

I hope people will learn from my code. Its a good example of how to
quickly and easily port an emulator to the ps2, so hopefully people
will learn from this example and start porting other emulators.

Note that a few minor bugs have been discovered in PSMS, but I havent
had time to fix them so they are still present in this source code.
The *known* bugs are:
1) Rom filenames are not turned into capitals, which can cause problems
   if FILES.TXT has not been created properly.
2) The pad init code is badly designed, and it will cause the program to
   halt until one of the following conditions are met: a) No controller
   is inserted in port 1, or b) a dual-shock controller is insterted in
   port 1.

SjPCM is considered to be a seperate program from PSMS. SjPCM ee-side
source code is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. IOP-side code will be released once I clean the src.

Please contact me if you have any questions about the source code, or
if you use parts of the source code in a project.

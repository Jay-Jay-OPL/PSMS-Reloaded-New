PSMS Reloaded attempts to bring PSMS 1.2 (by Sjeep) back to life! It now
supports following devices, without relying on any special "FILES.TXT" index:

:. Memory Card
:. USB Devices
:. CD/DVD
:. HDD

This version was converted from PS2LIB/GFXPIPE to PS2SDK/GsKit by bootsector.

Thanks to the following people who (in)directly made this happen:

:. PS2SDK maintainers/developers
:. PS2DEV forum members (Lukasz and others)
:. ragnarok2040 for his menu component (used in FCEUltra for PS2)
:. dlanor and EP for LaunchElf and its source code
:. Sjeep for the quick and dirty, but still good PSMS port.
:. My lovely wife, Miriam, for letting me to spend some of our 
   valuable time with this ;)
   
This is a WIP project. There are still many features to be added!

Hope you folks enjoy it!

CD Creation
-----------

When PSMS boots, its looks for a file in the root directory of
the cd called "FILES.TXT". This file contains a list of all the
roms on the cd, and the actual game names for each of the roms.
In order for PSMS to work correctly, FILES.TXT must be made
correctly - dont expect PSMS to work right if you mess something
up. You have two choices when it comes to making your FILES.TXT
file: You can use a nice GUI app coded by Justice, or you can
create it manually. If you want to use the GUI app, download
from http://psms.gamebase.ca and follow the instructions
included in the archive. If you want to create your FILES.TXT
manually, follow the instructions below.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Organise the intended directory tree of the CD on your hard disk.
   The CD must conform to the ISO9660 standard. This imposes several
   limitations on how you can create your cd. All filenames and
   directory names may consist ONLY of the following characters:

   A-Z (in upper case!!), 0-9, '_'

   Filenames must be in 8.3 format - ########.### (ALEXKIDD.SMS
   or SONIC.GG are valid 8.3 filenames). You may not have more
   than 30 files per directory, so if you have more than 30 roms
   you must span them accross several directories (ie, ROMS1\
   ROMS2\ ROMS3\ - each of these dirs can hold up to 30 roms).

   Once you have the roms in the sorted out, place PSMS.ELF, SJPCM.IRX
   and SYSTEM.CNF so they will end up in the root directory of your CD.

2) Create the "FILES.TXT" file. This file accociates actual game
   names with filenames. You must use the full filenames realative
   to the root directory of the CD (ie, ROMS1\ALEXKIDD.SMS). The
   text file is set out as follows:

   Alex the Kidd,ROMS1\ALEXKIDD.SMS
   Asterix,ROMS2\ASTERIX.SMS
   California Games,ROMS3\CALIFGAM.SMS

   ... and so on.

   There must be a comma in-between the game name and filename.
   Make sure you press enter after the last entry (there must be a
   newline character after the last entry).

   There is currently a "bug" in the file reading code that PSMS
   uses - it can only read 16 bytes from a file at a time. If your
   file is NOT a multiple of 16 bytes, the last few characters will
   not be read. To fix this, pad the end of the file with spaces
   until it is a multiple of 16 byes.

3) Create a MODE 2 ISO with PSMS.ELF, SJPCM.IRX, FILES.TXT and
   SYSTEM.CNF in the root directory. Place the roms where you have
   specified in FILES.TXT (ie, if your FILES.TXT is set up like the
   example in step 2, place ROMS1\ ROMS2\ ROMS3\ in the root dir of
   your ISO). Make sure your CD writing software creates and burns
   the ISO with the correct settings. These are:

   - ISO9660 level 1 filesystem
   - ISO9660 character set
   - Joliet DISABLED
   - ISO9660 relaxations DISABLED

   You may also need to patch your image, depending on your booting
   method (some versions of AR/GS require SYSTEM.CNF to be at a
   certain location on the CD).

   Burn your ISO, and if you have set it up properly, ENJOY!
